Requirements
	Server
		The main requirement for an OneCloud installation is a PHP 5 running web server.
		OneCloud has its own virtual file system and does not require a database to work. You will however need the capability of uploading files and directories to the webspace and to be able to change folder permissions.
	Client (Web Browser)
		Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes the common modern browsers:
			* Mozilla Firefox
			* Google Chrome
			* Internet Explorer
			* Opera
		Lower versions and other browsers may also work. We strongly recommend the use of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to be able to use all OneCloud effects!
